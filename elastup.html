                    Elastup is a multipurpose cutlery holder designed for lunch boxes, combining functionality
                    with a touch of elegance. 
                    Launched on April 03, 2025, on Kickstarter, this product features a durable elastic band 
                    paired with a piece of leather, offering a minimalist solution for organizing utensils on the go. <br>
                    In addition to its primary use, Elastup can also be used on tablets or notebooks to hold pens, making it a versatile
                    accessory.

                    We organised several brainstorming sessions lasting several hours to come up with an idea we could all agree on. 
                    Despite all our efforts, the idea didn't come to us during a brainstorming session 
                    but when one of our team members arrived one lunchtime with a tupperware on which his cutlery was held with a rubber band. 
                    The cutlery wasn't stable at all and the aesthetics of the elastic band on the tupperware clearly needed to be reviewed... <br>
                    <br>
                    So we came up with the idea of a fashionable cutlery holder for tupperware with a wider elastic band to make it more stable on the object. 
                    The combination of elastic and leather also adds a touch of elegance to the classic elastic design. After some thought, 
                    we realised that the project could be adapted to many more everyday objects.
                    For example: a notebook and its pen, an iPad and its apple pencil, lunchbox and its cutlery, etc. <br>  
                    That's how the Elastup was born!  <br>
                    <br>
                    We started by sketching the product on paper, then we created a model of the product using Solidworks.
                    Then from the schematic, we asked a manufacturer in the Marais district of Paris to produce a custom cutter that would allow us to shape the leather pieces.

                <p>

                    After numerous prototypes and brainstorming sessions, we finally settled on a size that could adapt to most lunchboxes, notebooks, and tablets.
                    For the colors, we wanted something simple and versatile — shades that anyone could wear. <br>
                    We first chose black leather, a timeless option that pairs easily with any style. Then, we introduced red and blue as a nod to the French flag and the "Made in France" label. <br>
                    Later on, we added "mystery colors" to reduce leather waste by using pieces too small to be crafted into bags or other leather goods. <br>
                    <br>
                    With the final product ready, we launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the production of our first series.
                    We took photos and videos of the Elastup in different situations to highlight its versatility and created various posters to promote the product ahead of the campaign launch.
                    We also produced a presentation video to showcase the product and its features.

                    Our goal was to produce at least 50 Elastups. To cover the production and material cost, we asked for 335€ on Kickstarter. 
                    To our suprise, the launching on April 3rd, went pretty well and at the end of the 20 days campaign, we were able to achieve 177% of our goal, with 593€ collected. <br>
                    Now that the campaign has ended, we need to start the production and delivered Elastup to our dearest contributors coming from various places.
