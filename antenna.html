                    As part of my major, we built a low-tech device to intercept signals from old satellites. The
                    project focused on receiving transmissions from NOAA weather satellites, which operate in the
                    137 - 138 MHz range and use Right Hand Circular Polarization (RHCP). Our goal was to construct a
                    simple yet effective receiving system using basic materials and accessible technology.

                <p class="presentation1">
                    For the antenna, we chose a V-dipole design, which offered a balance between ease of construction
                    and reliable reception. Each dipole element was cut to approximately 53.4 cm, optimized for the
                    target frequency. We mounted the antenna in a horizontal plane to minimize interference from
                    vertically polarized signals, such as commercial radio transmissions.

            <div class="presentation1">
                <p>
                    Once the antenna was assembled, we connected it to an RTL-SDR (Software-Defined Radio) dongle via a
                    coaxial cable. The SDR allowed us to tune into different frequencies and process the received
                    signals using a computer. To decode the satellite transmissions, we used WXtoImg, a specialized
                    program for processing NOAA satellite images.

                    The first test was a complete failure. Our satellite image was filled with too much noise and only
                    displayed a small portion of the expected transmission. To obtain a clear image, we had to capture
                    the satellite's signals three separate times, which significantly extended the process. <br>

                    This delay was mainly due to the need for precise timing and orientation. We had to carefully check
                    the satellite pass schedules to determine when they would be directly above us. Additionally, we
                    needed to constantly adjust the antenna's direction to ensure optimal signal reception, making the
                    process both time-consuming and challenging. <br>
                    <br>
                    On our last trial, we were finally able to capture a good image with minimal noise. While some
                    interference remained, the overall result was remarkably clear.

                    This time, the satellite transmission revealed a wide view of Western Europe, including France,
                    Italy, the UK, and surrounding regions. The level of detail in the image was impressive, allowing us
                    to distinguish cloud formations, coastlines, and major landmasses.

                    Lastly, we took the satellite images, inverted the colors to create a negative, and printed them
                    onto transparent film. Using these negatives, we experimented with **cyanotype printing**, a
                    photographic process that uses sunlight to develop images. <br>

                    By placing the transparencies on light-sensitive paper and exposing them to the sun, we created deep
                    blue-toned prints of the satellite images. This final step transformed our digital captures into
                    physical artworks, merging technology with traditional photographic techniques to produce unique
                    visual representations of the satellite data.

                    Overall, this project demonstrated that with a well-positioned V-dipole antenna, a simple SDR
                    receiver, and proper signal processing, it is possible to intercept and decode satellite
                    transmissions using a low-tech approach. This hands-on experience reinforced our understanding of
                    radio signal propagation, antenna design, and signal decoding, making it a valuable part of our
                    studies. <br>
