                    My project began with a simple question: "How can technology bring us closer to tradition, to others, and to ourselves?" <br>
                    <br>
                    In continuity with my vision to bridge technology and tradition I started asking my self which direction I wanted to explore next. 
                    As I was in Kyoto, the spiritual heart of Japan, surrounded by Shinto Shrines, I got quite interested into shinto beliefs and rituals. <br>
                    As I learned more about Japanese rituals and traditions, one word kept returning to me â€” connection. <br>
                    
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="presentation1">
                <p>
                    One of the centeral element that caught my attention was Sake, a traditional Japanese rice wine, often used in rituals. <br>
                    Sake is more than just a drink; it is a symbol of connection, a medium through which people come together to share moments, stories, and memories. <br>
                    In ancient times, the process of fermentation invisible to the human eye was believed to be the work of Gods, transforming rice into a sacred beverage. <br>
                    Sake was used in ceremonies to connect with the divine, purify the body and spirits, and build bonds. <br>
                    <br>
                    One other element i was inspired by was the Mirror. An element that have a strong significance in Shinto religion as a symbol of truth and self-reflection. <br>
                    The mirror is believed to reflect not just physical appearance but also the inner self, encouraging individuals to look inward and connect with their true nature. <br>
                    One specific type of mirror that intrigued me was the "Mizukagami", which translates to water (mizu) mirror (kagami). <br> 
                    This natural mirror forms on the surface of still water, reflecting the surrounding environment and creating a serene and contemplative space. 
                    The water does not just mirror the present, but evokes the passing of time, the change of seasons, and a connection between heaven and earth. 
                    Some believed that water mirrors acted as portals to the other world, linking us with those who lived before us.<br>
                    <br>
                    As you might have guessed from the name, this project "Sakekagami" is a fusion of these two concepts: Sake and Mizukagami. <br>
                    I thought what if I could create a mirror portal throught a cup of sake that connects us to tradition, to others, and to ourselves. <br>
                    A mirror that connects the past and the present, the physical and the spiritual, the individual and the collective. <br>
                    A cup that forges bonds across time and space, letting us share a drink and connect. <br>

                    Each custom masu cup is equipped with a Raspberry Pi, a miniature camera, and a small display. 
                    The cups communicate over a network: the camera in each cup captures the user's face, which is processed via TouchDesigner and StreamDiffusion to generate real-time images. 
                    These visuals are then projected inside the opposite cup, letting users encounter one another through a digital reflection.
